# Object Oriented programming using JavaScript

## What is Object Oriented Programming? (oop)

- oop is programming paradigm (style of the code) based on teh concept of objects;
- We use Objects to model (describe) real world or abstract features;
- Objects may contain data (properties) and code (method), By using Objects, we pack data and teh corresponding behavior into one block;
- In OOP, objects are self-contained pieces/blocks of code;
- object are building blocks of applications, and interact with one another;
- interactions happen through a public interface(API): method that the code outside of the object can access and use to communicate with the object;

### why just oop exist

well this paradigm was developed with the goal of organizing code, so to make it more flexible and easier to maintain.

## CLASS AND INSTANCES (TRADITIONAL OOP)

in traditional oop we use something called **CLASSES**.
<br>

_you can think of a class as a blueprint, which can then be used to create new objects based on the rules described in the class._

<br>
so it's just like an architecture where the architect develops a blueprint to exactly plan and describe a house.

## THE 4 FUNDAMENTAL OOP PRINCIPLES

1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

### PRINCIPLE1: ABSTRACTION

Abstraction: Ignoring or hiding details that don't matter, allowing us ot get an overview perspective of the thing we're implementing instead of messing with details that don't really matter to our implementation.
